# CasaLux LED Panel Broidge to WiFi

# What?
A WIP project to build a bridge for including CasaLux branded LED Panels that were sold by ALDI SÃ¼d (Germany) some time around 2021 ([Example](https://www.aldi-sued.de/de/p.casalux-led-panel.490000000000809780.html)) into Homeassistant.

# Why?
Because they hang everywhere in the house I rent and I don't want to modify anything about the hardware but still be able to remotely control them.

# How?
It seems like the units use a 2.4GHz Remote that works very close to the Milight Protocol that was already [reverse engineered](https://arduino-projects4u.com/milight-rf-control/), however they use another IC for the RF transmission.

The silkscreen on the chip is etched off, however it seems to be a [LT89XX](https://datasheet4u.com/datasheet-pdf/NST/LT8920/pdf.php?id=1404584) by NST Tech. The chip is pretty confidently identified by the initialisation sequence that basically matches the datasheet reccommendations bit-by-bit for all of the 20-or-so registers.
